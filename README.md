## Introduction

This repository contains a Fake News Detection project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to classify news articles or text as either "fake" or "real" by leveraging NLP methods and machine learning models. Detecting fake news is crucial in today's information age, as it helps promote the dissemination of accurate and reliable information.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6+
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/install.html)
- [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing.html)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn nltk gensim pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection-nlp.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd fake-news-detection-nlp
```

3. Install the required packages, as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

4. You're ready to start using the project!

## Usage

To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository. The notebook will guide you through the following steps:

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
2. Feature extraction: Transforming text data into numerical features using NLP techniques.
3. Model training: Building and training machine learning models for fake news detection.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics.

Execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook one by one to follow the project flow.

## Data

The data used in this project is not included in this repository, but you can find suitable datasets for fake news detection from reputable sources or by web scraping. Ensure you format your data into a suitable structure, including features and labels.

## Model

The project includes code for training and evaluating various machine learning models. You can explore and experiment with different models to see which one performs best for your specific dataset.

## Evaluation

The evaluation section provides insights into how well the models perform. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
